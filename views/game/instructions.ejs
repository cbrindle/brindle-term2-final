                <br>
                <p>An unassuming, humble farming town, Swiftfell Village lies nestled among the southern foothills of the Sundirra Realm. Most who reside within the walls of Swiftfell spend their day cultivating the land and selling their crops to merchant caravans passing through towards the capital. At first glance, the quaint hamlet appears as unremarkable as one would assume. However, Swiftfell has been home of the fabled Hero's Academy for hundreds of years. Here, would-be champions of peace are separated from those simply filled with delusions of grandeur.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The establishment of the Hero's Academy in such a unremarkable location is no happenstance. Swiftfell is also home to the Aeon Crystal. A mysterious element, whose origin remains unclear to this day, emits an ethereal energy, seeming to repel creatures consumed by dark energy. For generations, the Heroes of Swiftfell have sworn a sacred oath to protect the Aeon Crystal for the good of mankind.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As the world grows larger, so have the forces of evil. As a result, Swiftfell Heroes often find themselves sought after by neighboring town governance, and at times by order of the High Crown, to aid in dispelling troops of monsters that plague the realm. This has lead those who seek fortune to apply for admittance into the Hero's Academy. Growing concerns of the traditions of the past being forgotten has lead to rigorous standards that must be met in order to graduate from the Academy.</p>

                <br>
                <p><b>Turn-Based Combat: </b>TFS utilizes a turn-based combat system. At the start of a combat turn, you select an action for each of your party members. Once all selections have been made, an agility stat calculation is made to determine the order of actions carried out.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Attack: </b>Using your Hero's equipped weapon, attack a selected target to deal damage. Classes that have strong Attack ability are Hero and Warrior.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Guard: </b>Your Hero takes up a defensive posture and guards against any incoming physical attack that round. Typically, the damage your Hero would have taken is reduced by 50%.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Magic: </b>Select a spell to cast that round. A spell may deal damage, heal a Hero, grant a status buff, or inflict a status aliment on an enemy.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Special: </b>Every combat action your Hero takes earns him/her Technique Points. Special moves cost various Technique Points and, like spells, can have varying effects depending on the Hero's class.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Item: </b>Use an item from your inventory in combat. An item may restore a Hero's Hit Points or Magic Points, cure status aliments, or have some other effect.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Escape: </b>Allows your party to flee battle. This is best to use if your Heroes are running low on HP or if an enemy is too strong.</p>

He is in his last year and is preparing to take the Hero's Exam any day now.

She vowed that no one else should have to endure the pain she did, prompting Sheryl to seek training under famed Hero, Master. While not adept at spell casting, Sheryl's raw power and battle-rage techniques more than make up for her lack of affinity with the spiritual realm.</p>
